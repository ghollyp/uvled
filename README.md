# Cyanotype with UV LED Matrix

![uvled logo](https://github.com/ghollyp/uvled/wiki/pictures/uvled-logo-800.jpg)

## What is it ?
As the title may suggest it is a combination of a photographic printing technique called [Cyanotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype) 
and [Ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) [Light-emitting diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) as a 
source of UV light to expose the image. But instead of using UV LEDs in a light box to create source of even ultraviolet light I use a matrix 
of diodes controlled by [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). The controlling of each single LED in the matrix allows me to create various patterns of dots on the paper or fabric.
In order to place the matrix precisely on the paper I have built simple XY gantry controlled by [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Uno with [grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/) shield.
