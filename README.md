# Cyanotype with UV LED Matrix
## What is it ?
As the title may suggest it is a combination of photographic printing technique called [Cyanotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype) 
and [Ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet) [Light-emitting diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) as a source of UV light to expose the image. But instead of using UV LEDs in a light box to create source of even light. 
I use a matrix of diodes controlled by [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). This allows me to create various patterns of dots by controlling each single LED in the matrix. 
To position the matrix precisely I have built simple XY gantry controlled by [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Uno with [grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/).
